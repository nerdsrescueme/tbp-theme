Team Builders Plus Theme
========================

This theme was created for [Team Builders Plus](http://teambuildersplus.com) as part
of the [Nerd Content Management System](http://nerdphp.com). The site has since been
released, and rights to this theme have been transferred to TBP as the contractor
of that work.

Any questions or comments about this theme should be directed to TBP. It has been
discussed that this theme will be shared as a study in how to create Nerd CMS themes.
I must stress that this theme is (c) Team Builders Plus, Inc, but they have agreed to
allow this theme's code to be shared. Please do not copy this theme unless you plan
on make *significant* changes.

Thanks!
